# *Deep Learning with Python*

This repository contains the exercises I complete from the book *Deep Learning with Python* by Francois Chollet on my journey to become a deep learning expert. 
Every chapter (except 1) has exercises that I will be completing.

### Organization of the repo

Every chapter that contains exercises will have its own directory within this repo. 
Within each chapter directory there may be simply files (if there was only 1 exercise), or more directories to put each exercise into its own directory. 
For example, chapter 4 has 3 basic deep learning models - binary classification, multiclass classification, and regression. 
Each of these 3 models and any code they will need will be in their own directory.

### Current Progress

I am currently on chapter 3.
